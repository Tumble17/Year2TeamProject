# Year2TeamProject
This repository contains the source folder from our group project. We succeeded in creating a multiplayer, client-server AI game. It was based with up to four user players but using UDP we were able to send datagrams from server to client which could be decoded for any theoretical amount.

Although I did not write every line of every class file positioned in the folders, we worked iteratively on all aspects and programmed in pairs meaning that we would understand the entirety of the solution. 

I project managed the group and worked mainly with game physics and networking. I was then able to create intuitive and sophisticated AI which built an enjoyable game state to life.
